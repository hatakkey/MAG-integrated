# **MAG-Integrated: 4G Non-CUPS Simulation using Open5GS, srsRANSim, BNGBlaster, and ContainerLab**

**MAG-Integrated** is an open-source project that simulates a **4G Non-CUPS (Centralized User Plane Separation)** network architecture. This project utilizes **ContainerLab** for container-based network simulation, **Open5GS** for the core network, **srsRANSim** for simulating the radio components (eNB and UE), and **BNGBlaster** for broadband access emulation using **PPPoE** and **IPoE**.

## **Overview**

This project is designed to simulate a 4G mobile network without the need for centralized user plane separation (CUPS). It integrates **Open5GS** as the core network solution and uses **BNGBlaster** to simulate broadband access via PPPoE and IPoE. The entire network is deployed in a containerized environment using **ContainerLab**, enabling rapid setup and flexible testing of network configurations.

The goal of this project is to provide an efficient, scalable, and flexible way to simulate a 4G Non-CUPS network using open-source tools.

## **Features**

- **Containerized Simulation**: Uses **ContainerLab** for efficient deployment and orchestration of network components.
- **Open5GS**: Implements an open-source 4G core network with key elements such as MME (Mobility Management Entity), HSS (Home Subscriber Server), and PCRF (Policy and Charging Rules Function).
- **PPPoE/IPoE Simulation**: Enables broadband access testing with **BNGBlaster**.
- **Flexible Setup**: Customizable network topology and components.
- **Open Source**: Suitable for research, testing, and educational purposes.

## **Components**

### **1. Nokia traditional BNG(Broadband Network Gateway)**
- **Nokia's traditional BNG** is a key network element that connects end-users to the core network via technologies like DSL or fiber It handles:
  - IP Addressing: Assigns IPs to devices.
  - AAA: Manages authentication, authorization, and accounting.
  - Traffic Management: Ensures QoS and traffic prioritization.
  - Session Management: Tracks user sessions.
- The BNG supports IPoE and PPPoE for broadband access, offering scalability and reliability for service providers.

### **2. ContainerLab**
- **ContainerLab** is used to simulate network components in isolated containers, making the environment lightweight and manageable.
- It orchestrates network elements, including **Open5GS**, **BNGBlaster**, and **srsRANSim**.

### **3. Open5GS**
- **Open5GS** provides the **Evolved Packet Core (EPC)** components, such as **MME**, **HSS**, and **PCRF**.
- Configured in **Non-CUPS** mode, meaning the control and user planes are not separated.

### **4. BNGBlaster**
- Simulates **PPPoE** and **IPoE** sessions for broadband access testing.

### **5. srsRANSim** 
- Provides an open-source LTE/5G software radio stack.
- Simulates **UE** and **eNB/gNB**, facilitating mobile network emulation.

### **6. FreeRADIUS**
- An open-source **RADIUS server** for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA).
- Supports **EAP, PAP, CHAP** and integrates with **MySQL, PostgreSQL, and LDAP**.
- Used in ISPs and telecom networks for network access control.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Docker**: Required for running containerized components.
- **ContainerLab**: For managing container-based network simulations.
- **Git**: For cloning this repository.

---

### **Getting Started**

Follow the **[documentation](docs/installation_verification.md)** for detailed setup instructions.

---

### **Installation Steps**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/htakkey/cups-integrated.git
   cd cups-integrated
   ```
#### **2. Create Required Network Bridges**

For **CentOS** (example):
```bash
[root@compute-1 scripts]# ./create_bridges-centos.sh
```
   
#### **3. Deploy the ContainerLab Environment**

Run the following command to deploy the simulated network:
```bash    
clab deploy -t mag-integrated.clab.yml
```
#### **4. cliscripts**
For simplicity ,you can download the cliscripts to the CF1 of the BNG and TRA to execute the needed commands
```bash
[root@compute-1]# pwd
/root/MAG-integrated/cliscripts/
```
   
#### **5. Register a 5G Subscriber**

Use this script to register the **IMSI** with a specific apn,opc and key
```bash
 root@compute-1 scripts]# ./register_subscriber.sh 
 ```
	
##### **5.1 GUI Access to the Database**
You can verify subscriber records via **Web GUI**:

ðŸ“Œ **URL**: `http://x.x.x.x:9999/' 
ðŸ“Œ **Username/Password**: `admin/1423'

#### **6. Start the Open5GS Core Network**
Run the following script to start the 4G Core( **HSS** and **MME**)
Follow the **[documentation](docs/open5gs_verification.md)** for detailed information/checking .

```bash
[root@compute-1 scripts]# ./start_open5gs.sh
```
#### **7. Start the 4G Session**
Start the 4G session 
Follow the **[documentation](docs/4G_session_verification.md)** for detailed information/checking .

![Network Topology](images/4g-non-cups.png)


```bash
cd scripts
./start_4g_bng.sh
```

#### **8. Start PPPoE/IPoE Session using BNGBlaster**
Start the broadband session using **BNGBlaster**:
Follow the **[documentation](docs/fixed-sessions_verification.md)** for detailed information/checking .

![Fixed Network Topology](images/fixed-bng.png)

```bash
cd scripts
./start_dhcp_bng.sh
./start_pppoe_bng_traffic.sh   ## (Starts session with traffic)
```
    
---

#### **9. Troubleshooting**

The logs are available for further checking, tcpdump can be used to capture the traffic for any bridge/port
also  there is another option can be integrated with this containerlab is EdgeShark https://containerlab.dev/manual/wireshark/
